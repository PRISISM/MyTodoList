# MyTodoList
## Project Details
A minimal to-do list Single-page application built in the MEAN stack. It allows users to log-in and register in order to view and update 
their personal list.

A running version of the app can be found at https://toashel-todo.herokuapp.com

The following technologies were used for developing MyTodoList:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB/Mongoose
* Angular
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Passport
* JWT

### Motivation
I built this small app as an introduction to Angular and how to integrate it with the rest of the MEAN stack, which I had been 
learning previously. 

My main goal was to follow the various Angular style guides around the internet and try to achieve best practices, but I still 
have a lot to work on when I tackle my next projects using these technologies.
